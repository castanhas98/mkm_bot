## Common Issues
- 21/Feb/2024: New chromium version, 122, was set to latest/candidate but not latest/release. Let's see how long it takes to fix. Error when launching `driver = uc.Chrome(...)`.
Error:
```
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot connect to chrome at 127.0.0.1:42983
from session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 122
Current browser version is 121.0.6167.184
```
After a WebDriverException was caught (maybe nice to print the stack trace?)
